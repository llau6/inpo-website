In the three years I’ve been here I’ve grown more knowledgeable in both costumer service skills and computer hardware and software troubleshooting. When I had first started here, I wasn’t very confident with my ability to communicate appropriately to customers, especially when on the phone or through emails. Now I have no problem effectively explaining exactly what I need to and respectfully communicating with customers. Part of this is thanks to one of the certifications that INPO offers to co-ops which is focused on customer support skills, but the biggest thing that helped me were my coworkers. The people here are the nicest and most fun group I’ve ever had a chance to work with. One of my favorite times of the year is Halloween, because almost the entire IT department will dress up, and then spend the day working in costume. I was also impressed with how much people were willing to teach me about their jobs. Just from talking to other people on the floor I learned about networking, server management, virtualization, and our telephony system. Another aspect of this job that impressed me was the certifications offered; INPO paid so I could train and get certifications that I will now be able to show off to any future employers. All the training I received increased my understanding of a computer’s hardware system, and windows operating system. The information I learned from my A+ training is what helped me get started with building my own personal desktop. This job has also helped me develop leadership skills. During my last semester I was able to be the co-op Team Lead, which meant I was helping manage the other co-ops and they would come to me with any questions. The decision to take this job is one I will never regret, and is one I would recommend for anyone interested in the IT world. </blockquote>' +

                    "Before INPO, you could say that I was quite a hermit crab, in the sense that it was easier to climb Mount Everest than to get me to talk. Everything changed, though, when I started co-oping at INPO. Working at the IT Service Desk has not only helped me gain basic knowledge about computers and other IT equipment, but it has also gotten me out of my shell. Surprisingly enough, it wasn't just the customer service portion of the job that got me to speak up; it was also the great people whom I worked with. One main reason why I chose to work for this company was because of the people and the environment. It is impossible not to make friends in this company, whether they are in the same department or not. The fact that this is a smaller company helps foster such friendships. I have not only worked with a bunch of crazy, full-of-life, kind, and smart co-ops and IT folks, I have also worked with kind and compassionate INPO employees. The customer service and the computer repair sides of the job have increased my knowledge of computers in general, since I came into the world of computers as a rookie. Troubleshooting skills, problem solving skills, and leadership skills are only just a few examples of what I've learned here, and those are key to succeeding in any part of my life whether it be college or any other job. I will value each and every experience that INPO has given me, and in the future, I hope to work for a company that has the amount of integrity and excellence as INPO. As one of my favorite song says \"Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road, Time grabs you by the wrist directs you where to go.\" Well, for me, I will always be happy about the day I chose INPO. INPO has been my major stepping stone for my future, and I will never forget the people I have worked with and all the good times we have shared. " +

This meant that I no longer had to work on menial tasks like making cables. I was now a part of the front line of defense for any calls that came into the INPO IT Department.

Co-workers in the IT department, and the people throughout the company as a whole, are nothing but supportive and willing to offer advice and words of wisdom.  Being a smaller company, a co-op job at INPO is one of importance and people will look for you to solve real problems in a timely manner.

From the day I first interviewed with INPO, it was stressed that I was there to learn and that my mistakes, if any, were part of the learning process.  Part of the education process was growing my leadership skills and communication skills, for which I am thankful for and will serve me well as I apply for my first job out of college.  The permanent employees of INPO never treated me in any way other than as an equal, and the experience you can glean from them is limitless.  Expressing desire to expand your knowledge outside of your job description is not only encouraged, but someone will be there to help you grow if you show the interest to do so." +

It was always a constant challenge to open up and interact with everyone from my fellow co-ops to customers. I had a lot of technical knowledge but, the most challenging part was getting used to the work environment. There were a lot of rules, polices, and procedures to follow closely.

I really appreciate the certifications and training that INPO offered to me. From learning about computer components to crucial conversations, I benefited a lot from them. Not only was I offered great training material, I had to put it into use every day at my job. To me, hands-on learning is the best. I can train all day about something but if I don’t put it to use, then it is useless to me." +

INPO puts you in a team with other co-ops of various levels of expertise to support the whole company. I was never alone in my job and received a lot of help from my teammates. That was a great aiding factor when I was lost and had no clue on what to do. My team was also there to evaluate and aid in my growth. Feedback was essential and helping each other was one of our number one priorities. Thanks to them, I was able to discover my weaknesses and remedy them before going out to the real world." +

                    "My experience at INPO has been many things to me: enlightening, interesting, rewarding, and enjoyable. It was enlightening because it was my first real-world programming experience. Working with real-world programs, and finding real-world solutions has been a valuable experience. Working on programs that others will use provides a sense of satisfaction at the end of each workday. It was interesting because I rarely had to do the exact same thing twice. As a programmer analyst, there are numerous job tasks that I had to do, the majority being different. It was rewarding because of the competitive pay INPO offers as well as the nice break from school. INPO also offers a couple of bonuses each semester that students can take advantage of. Lastly, my INPO experience has been enjoyable. The INPO IT department consists of a wide variety of people with different ages, ethnicities, and genders. Co-ops work with many interesting, humorous, and fun people. Looking over my co-op experience, choosing to work at INPO has been a good decision." +

                    "Have you ever heard of the expression, “Where you end up has a lot to do with where you start?” You might not care but this simple expression has been repeatedly drilled into my brain over the years. But I never actually bothered to understand what it meant until a couple of years ago. I heard it when people said it but I never really listened to what they were trying to say." +
                    "<br><br>I came to the realization midway through my college career that I do not know where to start, when to start, how to start, or even what to start. I thought high school and college were supposed to prepare me for the real world, to help me hone in my skills in order to determine the best possible path for me. But studying, researching, and listening to someone only goes so far. These tasks get mundane and repetitive but an actually hands-on experience is totally different. This is what cooping is to me, an actual hands-on experience." +
                    "<br><br>Initially, I was mainly interested in obtaining a coop position related to my field. I was able to obtain that. I heard rumors about other co-op jobs where coops were given meager tasks like stapling papers or making copies but I wanted my coop experience to be more than that, which it has proven to be. My coop job allowed me to develop leadership, communication, and customer service skills among other skills." +
                    "<br><br>I worked as a PC Support co-op for four semesters at INPO. When I first started at INPO, I was extremely shy and knew very little about troubleshooting computers. Working in the helpdesk proved to be a good experience for me. Not only has it allowed me to work with a very diverse group of people but it has allowed me to learn a lot about computers, the importance of customer service, project management, and various aspects of the information technology field." +
                    "<br><br>My experience cooping at INPO has been a beneficial and practical experience. If you put into the program what you hope to get out, it can be very rewarding. It has served as a learning experience, a starting point for me to determine where to go in my field. INPO has taught me the importance of teamwork and a friendly working environment." +
